                When PhoneFood's founder and CEO Stephen TANJUNG moved to Hong Kong in 2018 he discovered a city full of great
                restaurants, but he was amazed that so few of them delivered food. He made it his personal mission to
                bring the best local restaurants direct to peopleâ€™s doors.
                <br>
                By offering fast and reliable delivery which the customer can track on their phone, PhoneFood has seen
                revenue growth of over 650% year on year. Restaurants who partner with us see their revenue increase by
                up to 30%, creating thousands of jobs in the restaurant sector.
